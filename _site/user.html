<p>Hi. I go by Naya.</p>

<p>I’m a 17 year old nerd who likes to code sometimes, be it homebrew, desktop applications/utilities, etc.</p>

<p>I’m aroace and non-binary… Or at least until I realized I’m a girl recently.</p>

<p>I’ve mainly been doing C, C++, and C#, though I’ve also been transitioning to Rust (Most cis Rustacean).</p>

<p>I also have an interest in collecting stuff.</p>
