Hi. I go by Naya.

I'm a 17 year old nerd who likes to code sometimes, be it homebrew, desktop applications/utilities, etc.

I'm aroace and non-binary... Or at least until I realized I'm a girl recently.

I've mainly been doing C, C++, and C#, though I've also been transitioning to Rust (Most cis Rustacean).

I also have an interest in collecting stuff.
